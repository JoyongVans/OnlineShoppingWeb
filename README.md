## Simulating User Operations for Making an Order

To simulate a user making an order, you can use the existing customer data (customer Email) in our database.  

### Order Processing Logic  

- **Read Customer Record** from the database to get the customer class and apply the corresponding discount:  

  | Customer Class      | Discount       |
  |---------------------|----------------|
  | Normal customer     | No discount    |
  | Silver customer     | 4% discount    |
  | Gold customer       | 6.5% discount  |

- **Calculate Order Amount**:  
  - Original amount = price Ã— quantity  
  - Net amount = original amount Ã— (1 â€“ discount %)  

- **Update Records**:  
  - Add the order record to the database.  
  - Update the customer's accumulated bonus:  
    `accumulated bonus = accumulated bonus + net amount`  
  - Save the updated customer record.
